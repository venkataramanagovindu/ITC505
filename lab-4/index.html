        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This addendum explains the reasoning behind the choices made in the HTML representation of the resume and the CSS styling applied to it.</p>

        <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
        <p><strong>Font Choices:</strong> The primary font used is Arial, a clean and widely available sans-serif font, ensuring readability and professionalism.</p>
        <p><strong>Heading Sizes:</strong> The main heading (h1) is set to 2.5em to create a strong emphasis on the name. Section headings (h2) are set to 2em with a blue color and a bottom border to differentiate sections. Subheadings (h3 and h4) are progressively smaller to create a clear hierarchy.</p>
        <p><strong>Color Choices:</strong> Blue shades (#0073e6 and #005bb5) are used for headings and links to create a cohesive and professional look. The main text color is dark gray (#333) for readability against the light gray background (#f4f4f9).</p>
        <p><strong>Margins and Padding:</strong> Consistent margins and padding are applied throughout to ensure proper spacing between elements. Sections are spaced out with margins to prevent clutter and improve readability.</p>

        
        <h3>HTML abuse</h3>
        <p>No instances of HTML abuse were found. The HTML structure uses appropriate semantic tags to ensure that the document is both logically structured and accessible.</p>
